		<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>In my time at Michigan, I have had the opportunity to teach an array of courses,
some for multiple terms. In 2012, I was recognized by the EECS deparment and won
the <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/events/GSI-awards-2012.html">2011-2012 CSE Undergraduate Instructor Award</a>.</p>
<p>Since beginning my graduate career, I have not yet had an opportunity to get back
to teaching, but am very much looking forward to the next time I will get the chance.</p>
<!---
W11 Course: EECS 298 Computing for Computer Scientists
------------------------------------------------------

I will be debuting a new 1 credit seminar next semester. The intention of the
course is teach students the fundamentals of unix, as well as other tools that
will be useful to them for their entire career as a computer scientist. The
focus is on learning what tools are available and how to work efficiently. For
more information, see the course syllabus here:

<h2>W12:</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs470/">EECS 470: Computer Architecture</a></h3>
<p>EECS 470 is a Major Design Experience (MDE, the Michigan term for an engineering
capstone course). It has a well-earned reptuation as one of the toughest MDEs at
Michigan and was a very different teaching experience. As I was only taking one
course this semester, I took on double hours supporting this course. We decided
to change the course format and transform early-semester recitation sessions
into labs. The course GSI, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pulkit-gupta/42/777/350">Pulkit Gupta</a>, and I developed the labs that
are still in use (as of W'14) today.</p>
<h3>EECS 482: Introduction To Operating Systems</h3>
<p>This was my fourth and final semester as an instructor for this course.</p>
<h2>F11:</h2>
<p>I was an Instructional Aide for two courses at the University of Michigan:</p>
<h3><a href="http://eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373-f11/">EECS 373: Design of Microprocessor-Based Systems</a></h3>
<p>I served as a lab instructor for this course. This was my second term as a
lab instructor for 373.</p>
<p>In addition to lab responsibilities, I built a novel simulator project for
the students. The project required students to build an ARM Cortex-M3
simulator, however, instead of the more traditional model of every student
implementing a carbon-copy project, the entire class had to work together on
one shared repository. A novel simulator architecture facilitated
collaborative work. Students "registered" opcode masks with callback functions
that "taught" the simulator core how to execute instructions (that is, the
decode stage would scan all registered handlers and call the student's
implementation of ADD, SUB, etc). In addition, students had to build
(simulated) reset hardware and a software library to run on the simulated
chip. The project was extremely interesting, and students reported it to be
"unlike anything they had ever seen before". Students had to learn the
challenges of developing and debugging their code, when the code of other
engineers on their project is also new and unreliable. In addition, they had
to deal with the challenges of co-operatively developing software and
hardware. In the end, we found the project to be a much more accurate
microcosm of real-world engineering - in particular new hardware development -
and in some cases exposing critical gaps in the skill set of our engineering
students.</p>

</ul>
<p>Continuing the trend of building a class students had "never seen before",
for the final exam (take-home), I built a reverse-engineering challenge. The
exam should still be live, and those interested in trying it out can use
the UMID 00011000 to try it yourself!</p>

</ul>
<h3><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pmchen/eecs482">EECS 482: Introduction To Operating Systems</a></h3>
<p>This is my third semester teaching this course. In this course I teach a
recitation and hold office hours. This course is more refined and traditional
than 373 (in fact, it's a bit of an institution at Michigan) and I am proud to
be a part of the course's legacy.</p>
<p>In addition to prescribed duties, I generally hold exam review sessions for
the midterm and the final.</p>
<h2>W11:</h2>
<p>This was my first term teaching two courses. The two courses were very
different in their required responsibilities. 482, which I was comfortable
with at this point, is a much more traditional recitation-style discussion
section. 373 was a new experience. As a lab instructor, I spent no time
lecturing. Rather, my time was spent helping to devlop and refine the labs
and with a lot of hands-on time with students helping them through the
tasks and challenges presented by the labs.</p>
<h3>EECS 373: Design of Microprocessor-Based Systems</h3>
<h3>EECS 482: Introduction To Operating Systems</h3>
<p>This was my second term teaching this course. In the winter semester, 482
is taught by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jflinn/">Jason Flinn</a>. Jason's
style is a little different than Pete's---a little more hands-on with the
course staff. It was interesting to see a different perspective on what
is, nominally, the same course.</p>
<h2>F10:</h2>
<p>This was my first term teaching. At Michigan, undergraduate students are
offered the opportunity to be Instructional Aides (IA's). An IA often
covers discussion (recitation) sections for larger courses.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pmchen/eecs482">EECS 482: Introduction To Operating Systems</a></h3>
<p>I was offered the opportunity to teach either 281 (Intro to Algorithms) or 482
(Operating Systems). I have always had a passion for low-level internals, and
the opportunity to teach our OS course aligned best with my interests.</p>
