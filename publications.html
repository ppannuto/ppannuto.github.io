			<pre>We demonstrate PolyPoint, a high-fidelity RF-based indoor localization system that
achieves 28~cm accuracy indoors and tracks a fast-moving quadcopter with only
56~cm average error.
PolyPoint uses ultra-wideband signals to achieve high precision RF time-of-flight
estimates between nodes. To further improve accuracy, PolyPoint exploits two forms
of diversity: frequency diversity, which leverages several ultra-wideband
channels to improve channel response, and antenna diversity, which adds three
antennas at $120\degree$ offsets to mitigate the effects of antenna
polarization and nulls. PolyPoint introduces an efficient, novel ranging protocol
that maximizes these diversity sources with a minimal number of packets.

Additionally, this work introduces a new hardware platform that provides
ranging and localization as a service. The minimal \emph{TriPoint} module
integrates an ultra-wideband transceiver and microcontroller with firmware
that implements the PolyPoint protocol. The \emph{TriTag} carrier board adds
Bluetooth and batteries to create a complete mobile tag, and the
\emph{TriBase} anchor platform integrates a TriPoint with an Intel Edison to
act as anchors for the system.

			<pre>Building connected, pervasive, human-facing, and responsive applications
that incorporate local sensors, smartphone interactions, device actuation, and
cloud-based learning---the promised features of the Internet of
Things (IoT)---requires a complete suite of tools spanning both hardware and software.
We present a set of these pieces, including a gateway, four hardware building
blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an indoor localization system, and software
for connecting users and devices.
Each piece plays an integral role towards
enabling applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart
devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of components.
By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit offers cohesive
support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric applications---typical
in today's IoT landscape---and towards richer applications that incorporate
multiple data streams, human interaction, cloud processing, location awareness,
multiple communication protocols, historical data, access control, and
on-demand user interfaces.
To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based
access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting,
but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and
nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts
to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

			<pre>Rust, a new systems programming language, provides
compile-time memory safety checks to help eliminate runtime bugs that
manifest from improper memory management. This feature is advantageous
for operating system development, and especially for embedded OS
development, where recovery and debugging are particularly challenging.
However, embedded platforms are highly event-based, and Rust's memory
safety mechanisms largely presume threads. In our experience developing
an operating system for embedded systems in Rust, we have found that
Rust's {\em ownership} model prevents otherwise safe resource sharing
common in the embedded domain, conflicts with the reality of hardware
resources, and hinders using closures for programming asynchronously.
We describe these experiences and how they relate to memory safety as
well as illustrate our workarounds that preserve the safety guarantees
to the largest extent possible. In addition, we draw from our
experience to propose a new language extension to Rust that would
enable it to provide better memory safety tools for event-driven
platforms.

			<pre>We introduce PolyPoint, the first RF localization system which enables the
real-time tracking and navigating of quadrotors through complex indoor
environments.  PolyPoint leverages the new ScenSor transceiver from DecaWave
to acquire the timestamps necessary for accurate time-based location
estimation and leverages the benefits of antenna and frequency diversity to
iteratively refine a tag's position.
PolyPoint produces quadrotor position estimates at a rate of 20\,Hz with
median error below 40\,cm and average error of 56\,cm in line-of-sight
conditions.  PolyPoint approaches the localization accuracy necessary to safely
navigate quadrotors indoors, a feat currently achieved by costly and
delicate optical motion capture systems.

			<pre>As we show in this paper, I/O has become the limiting
factor in scaling down size and power toward the goal of
invisible computing. Achieving this goal will require
composing optimized and specialized---yet
reusable---components with an interconnect that permits
tiny, ultra-low power systems.  In contrast to today's
interconnects which are limited by power-hungry
pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our
approach provides a superset of common bus features but
at lower power, with fixed area and pin count, using
fully synthesizable logic, and with surprisingly low
protocol overhead.

We present \textbf{MBus}, a new 4-pin,
22.6\,pJ/bit/chip chip-to-chip interconnect made of two
``shoot-through'' rings.  MBus facilitates ultra-low
power system operation by implementing automatic
power-gating of each chip in the system, easing the
integration of active, inactive, and activating
circuits on a single die.  In addition, we introduce a
new bus primitive: power oblivious communication, which
guarantees message reception regardless of the
recipient's power state when a message is sent.  This
disentangles power management from communication,
greatly simplifying the creation of viable, modular,
and heterogeneous systems that operate on the order of
nanowatts.

To evaluate the viability, power, performance,
overhead, and scalability of our design, we build both
hardware and software implementations of MBus and show
its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve
custom chips from three different semiconductor
processes.  A three-chip, 2.2\,mm$^3$ MBus system draws
8\,nW of total system standby power and uses only
22.6\,pJ/bit/chip for communication.  This is the
lowest power for any system bus with MBus's feature
set.

			<pre>In developing technology for indoor localization, we have recently
begun exploring commercially available state of the art localiza-tion technologies.
The DecaWave DW1000 is a new ultra-wideband
transceiver that advertises high-precision indoor pairwise ranging
between modules with errors as low as 10 cm. We are currently ex-ploring this
technology to automate obtaining anchor ground-truth
locations for other indoor localization systems. Anchor positioning
is a constrained version of indoor localization, with minimal time
constraints and static devices. However, as we intend to include the
DW1000 hardware on our own localization system, this provides
an opportunity for gathering performance data for a commercially-enabled
localization system deployed by a third-party for comparison purposes.
We do not claim the ranging hardware as our originalwork, but we do provide a
hardware implementation, an infrastruc- ture for converting pairwise measurements
to locations, and the front-end for viewing the results.</pre>

			<pre>Meaningful, reusable applications built on top of ubiquitous and networked
devices will be slow to materialize as long as device APIs vary widely, communication
protocols are not standardized, and programming support is limited and
inconsistent. When even feature-identical devices present different APIs
and application creators are burdened with managing the variability,
the promise of the swarm of devices will go unrealized. We start addressing
this issue by providing a model for devices, based on input and output ports, that allows for a set of common
interfaces to represent a range of devices. Further, we provide a solution
to the bootstrapping problem, providing a general means to
bridge the adoption gap for a new API for the Internet of Things.
We borrow both the name, \emph{accessor}, and several key design concepts from
a recent proposal by Latronico~et.\,al, for our interface layer that wraps
currently non-conforming devices with the standard interface. We show how
a small, straightforward to write (and read) JavaScript file can convert
diverse devices into common interfaces that are conducive for creating applications.

We realize our system with three environments that can execute accessors,
Python, Java, and Node.js, a range of accessors for both IoT and legacy devices,
and a browser-based application for interacting with devices using our proposed
interfaces. We show how the same accessor mechanism can form synthetic devices
with higher-level interfaces and we outline how our system can be extended
to support authentication, accessor control, and cloud storage support.

minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
additional power draw for each tag and complying with all
US~UWB regulations.  We believe this architecture's
combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

			<pre>Currently, researchers study face-to-face interactions using wearable sensors and
smartphones which provide 2 to 5~m proximity sensing every 20 to 300~s.
However, studying interaction distance, which is known to
impact disease spread, communication behavior, and other phenomenon, has
proven challenging.
Smartphones are limited by their inaccurate and/or
impractical ranging capabilities, while wearable sensors
are limited by their need for
infrastructure nodes, bulkiness, and/or inaccurate ranging.
To address these challenges, we present Opo, a 14~cm$^2$, 11.4~g ``lapel pin''
built from commercial components.
Opo sensors range neighbors every 2~s up to 2~m away with 5\% average
error, all while requiring zero
infrastructure and improving upon current wearable sensors' accuracy and power usage.
The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19~\uA
when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range
neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry
RF discovery protocols.
Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5~cm)
and temporal fidelity (2~s) on a limited power budget.

			<pre>For the last fifteen years, research explored the hardware,
software, sensing, communication abstractions, languages, and
protocols that could make networks of small, embedded
devices---motes---sample and report data for long
periods of time unattended.
Today, the application and technological landscapes
have shifted, introducing new requirements and new
capabilities. Hardware has evolved past 8~and 16~bit
microcontrollers: there are now 32~bit processors with
lower energy budgets and greater computing capability.
New wireless link layers have emerged, creating
protocols that support rapid and efficient setup and
teardown but introduce novel limitations that systems
must consider.
The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of
motes. We look towards new technologies such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex~M processors, and capable
energy harvesting, with new application spaces such as
personal area networks, and new capabilities and
requirements in security and privacy to inform
contemporary hardware and software platforms.  It is
time for a new, open experimental platform in this
post-mote era.

			<pre>We propose an ultra-low power interconnect bus for
millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. Using only 4~IO pads,
the bus minimizes the required chip real estate, enabling
ultra-small form factors in modular sensor node
designs. Low power is achieved using a ``clockless''
design of member nodes while aggressive power gating
allows an ultra-low power standby mode with only
53~gates powered on. An integrated wakeup scheme is
compatible with PMUs that have a special low power
standby mode. The MBus is fully synthesizable and uses
robust timing. Implemented in a 3~module system in
180~nm technology, Mbus achieves 8~nW of standby power
and 17.5~pJ/bit/chip.

			<pre>We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
updates.
The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
solved with optimization techniques.

The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera&rsquo;s image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques. </p>

			<pre>We introduce {\em Harmonia}, a new RF-based localization scheme
that provides the simplicity, cost, and power advantages of
traditional narrowband radios with the decimeter-scale
accuracy of ultra wideband localization techniques. Harmonia is
an asymmetric {\em tag} and {\em anchor} system, requiring
minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
additional power draw for each tag and complying with all
US~UWB regulations.  We believe this architecture's
combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

			<pre>We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
updates.
The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
solved with optimization techniques.  We explore the feasibility of
the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of
the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a
practical deployment including usability and scalability, and
demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and
more realistic human mobility scenarios.

			<pre>After years of development, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and
long-lasting solid-state lighting technology is finally a viable alternative
to incandescent and fluorescent lights.  Unfortunately, the remarkable march
of semiconductor technology into the lighting industry is almost entirely in
the form of a substitute good---one kind of lighting technology that replaces
another---but this, we argue, squanders a unique opportunity for lighting to
enable a bevy of new applications.  In this paper, we discuss applications in
health, energy efficiency, entertainment, communications, indoor positioning,
device configuration, and time synchronization.  We then prototype several of
the indoor applications to explore a {\em software-defined lighting} (SDL)
architecture that could support them.

Using our prototyped applications, we next take a primitive stab at
demonstrating application coexistence, multiplexing multiple applications on
a single lighting network.  A major question raised by this effort is how to
multiplex these various applications in a more principled manner on a shared
lighting infrastructure whose primary role is illumination (implying that any
human-perceptible flicker or flashing will be unacceptable).
Looking ahead, we draw inspiration from software-defined networking's
approach to sharing the network, and software-defined radios' approach to
processing waveforms, to sketch the beginnings of an SDL architecture and its
application programming interfaces.

application space, poised to become the largest
electronics market for the semiconductor industry. IoT
devices are focused on sensing and actuating of our

application space and then identify two common
challenges that exist across this space: ultra-low

composable components. We survey recent low power
techniques and discuss a low power bus that enables
modular design. Finally, we conclude with three example

			<pre>The power grid is one of humanity's most significant engineering
undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations
alike.  Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on
utility companies and more fine-grained insight is provided by
costly smart meter deployments. We claim that greater
visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
specific to this application as well as ones that are common
to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better
support such applications in the future.</pre>

			<pre>In this demo, we explore the critical role that power plays in the development
of a mm-scale system. We argue that any practical deployment of a mm-scale
system must have a significant energy harvesting component. We demo the newest
M3 system, a self-contained, 1~mm$^3$, energy-harvesting computing platform
capable of short-range (order~cm) wireless transmission.
Finally, we present some of the M3's innovations that
enable its current basic operation and discuss some of the open problems that
remain before a smart dust network becomes operable.</pre>

			<pre>We propose Get All The Data (GATD), a data collection and dissemination
system for the Swarm. GATD offers a flexible architecture to connect arbitrary
producers of data and consumers of events. Too many sensor networks are
fragile, vertical silos, with a series of one-off handlers written to shuttle
data, manipulate it, process it, and present it. Instead of being mired
in details and rigid schemas, we argue that sensor network deployment should
be simple. The key in GATD's design is the
observation that there are common patterns to how disparate sensor network
applications handle and process their generated data.

To take advantage of these
similarities we present a system comprised of common modules that
different applications can leverage.
To join GATD, new sensors simply send raw data. GATD will buffer this raw
data indefinitely until an application specific {\em formatter} is written to
map the raw data to key-value pairs. These streams can be combined, processed,
graphed, stored, or otherwise manipulated by a standard set of transforms or
new custom drivers. With this architecture, we argue that GATD provides a
robust, extensible, and versatile Swarm dataplane.

			<pre>Most modern software-defined radios are large, expensive, and
power-hungry, and this diminishes their utility in low-power,
size-constrained settings like sensor networks and mobile computing.
We explore the viability of scaling down the software radio in size,
cost, and power, and show that an index card-sized, sub-\$150, `AA'
battery-powered system is possible using off-the-shelf components.
Key to our approach is that we leverage an integrated, reconfigurable,
flash-based FPGA with a hard ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor which
simultaneously enables lower power and tighter hardware/soft\-ware
integration than prior designs.  This architecture allows us to
implement timing-critical MAC protocols and validate the speculated
performance of several recent MAC/PHY primitives and protocols
including Backcast, A-MAC, and Glossy using an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant
radio implementation that interoperates with commercial radios.  The
work also identifies several enhancements in the underlying hardware
components that could improve power, performance, and flexibility.

			<pre>In this work we expose the challenges of interfacing both conventional and new
systems with an extremely resource constrained platform. We find that even when
attempts are made to utilize an industry standard protocol (I2C), necessary
protocol modifications for ultra-low power design means that interfacing remains
non-trivial.

We present a functional 0.4mm~x~0.8mm ARM Cortex~M0 with 3KB of RAM, 24~GPIOs,
and an ultra-low power I2C interface. This chip is part of the Michigan Micro
Mote (M3) project, which is designed to build a complete software and hardware
platform for general purpose sensing at the millimeter scale. We demo an I2C
interface circuit allowing commercial hardware to program and interact with the
chip and present the beginning of the millimeter scale sensing revolution.

			<pre>
The SmartGrid is ushering in an era of new IP endpoints that already
reside on the power grid today, but lack network connectivity.  Many
of these endpoints -- refrigerators, air conditioners, and power
strips -- will be networked wirelessly.  However, since they already
exist on the power grid, a natural question is whether they might be
networked over the same wires that supply their power.  Such an
approach would allow SmartGrid sensors to vacate increasingly
congested spectrum and allow information to flow along the same path
as power, perhaps simplifying deployment in the short term and deep
demand response in the long term.
In this paper we explore the current state of Powerline Communications
(PLC) and explore the efficacy of PLC as a sensor network backbone in
a modern building.  We evaluate several different PLC modems in both
end-to-end and multi-hop configurations.  We further analyze building
blueprints to identify and correlate several PLC ``disruptors'' --
building facets that inhibit PLC.  Our preliminary results show that
PLC is a promising technology for networking sensors in the Smart
Building.  However, a number of anomalies suggest a more in-depth
study is warranted.
