Summary of Goals

In your own words, provide a summary of your educational program objectives
and your long-range professional goals.

    As part of this statement, we are interested in your ideas about:
      o the kinds of research in which you would like to be engaged during
        your graduate study or in the longer term;
      o specific research questions that interest you and how you became
        interested in them;
      o how your research might be of interest to the Department of Defense
        (DoD); and
      o your long-term goals and how the science fits into your life as an
        individual, especially your future career.

    Please discuss these research interests in sufficient detail for an expert
who is technically competent in your field to judge your understanding of the
questions to be addressed. This includes relevant hypotheses and approaches
one might take to answering the questions, and other research principles
required to investigate the research area you identify.

    We are interested in not only the science, but also your longer-term goals
and how the science fits into your life as an individual. We do not want this
to look like a grant submission.

Your response will be limited to 3,000 characters, including spaces. There is
